## 1.0.0.beta2
#### Additions
* Added better way to declare attribute inclusion/exclusion:
  `has_secretary on: []` and `has_secretary except: []`. This ensures that
  attributes will be declared before any `tracks_association` are called.
* Added support for singular associations tracking (has_one, belongs_to)
* Added support for Rails 4.1 (edge)


## 1.0.0.beta1 (2013-11-05)
* Beta for stable 1.0 release.


## 0.0.1
* Initial release
